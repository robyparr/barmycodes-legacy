    <h1>Bar My Codes Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,
        used, and shared when you visit or use Bar My Codes (the “Site”).
    </p>

    <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
    <p>
      The Site does not directly collect any personally identifiable information.
      However, some personally identifiable information will be automatically
      collected during the regular usage of the Site. This information is explained
      below.
    </p>

    <h4>Device Information</h4>
    <p>
      When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
      about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address,
      time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
      Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
      individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search
      terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact
      with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
      “Device Information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
      potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
      generally to improve and optimize the Site (for example, by generating
      analytics about how our users browse and interact with the Site, and to
      assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
    </p>

    <h4>Analytics</h4>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics to collect basic usage data about the Site. The
      analytics settings have been turned to the most private possible and no
      personally identifiable information will be sent to Google Analytics. This
      will also not place any cookies on your system.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can review Google's
        <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">
          analytics privacy policy
        </a> for more information.

    <p>
      When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
      are talking both about all information listed above.
    </p>

    <h3>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>
      We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us perform
      tasks and provide services, as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
      applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant
      or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
      protect our rights.
    </p>
